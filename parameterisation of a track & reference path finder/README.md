This folder contains the work related to the parameterisation of a race track and the optimization of a reference path using optimal control techniques.

## 📌 Contents

- Mathematical derivation of the track parameterisation
- Problem formulation and discretization of the reference path optimization task
- Python implementation using CasADi to solve the optimal control problem

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Implemented a method for track parameterisation
- [x] Formulated and discretized the reference path optimization problem
- [x] Developed Python code to solve the optimal control problem

## 🔧 To Do

- [ ] Add detailed annotations to the `.py` files
- [ ] Align the Python output format with the desired specification
- [ ] Summarize and integrate the mathematical background of the CasADi solver

> ⚠️ Some documents still require **extensive annotation**.
