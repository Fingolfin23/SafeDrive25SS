This folder is going to contain the mathematical derivation of the parameterisation of a track, the formulation of the reference path finding problem, the solution, together with the python implementation

Things have been down:
~method for parameterisation a track
~problem formulation and discretization for reference path optimization
~python implementation for solve the opt problem

Things to do:
~annotate the .py files
~align the python output to the desired output format
~read and add the casadi solver's mathematical background

!!!Some documents still need enormous annotation !!!
