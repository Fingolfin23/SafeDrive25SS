This folder contains the work related to the parameterisation of a race track and the optimization of a reference path using optimal control techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Contents

- Mathematical derivation of the track parameterisation
- Problem formulation and discretization of the reference path optimization task
- Python implementation using CasADi to solve the optimal control problem
- Nurburgring track data from https://github.com/TUMFTM/racetrack-database/tree/master
- a Track.py file defining a class containing all information about a given discrete track data (center line samples, etc.)
