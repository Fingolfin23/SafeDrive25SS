single traj. with CaSadi: round cycle, cubic bezier curve  
original version: no constraints  
update demo: 

8th May: trial of unconstrained model in straight line

11th May: 1.cubic bezier curve trajectory promoted, with maths model.  
2. naive unconstrained optimization model promoted, with CasADi code and maths model.  
3. trial for basic model with both round traj. and cubic bezier curve


19th MAY: now working on opt with double track and nonlinear tire. updated short version but lot to modify


20h MAY: uplodae trial.M, successfully finding the opt solution with double track plus nolinear tire while no constraints added now. need to add later

20th MAY: uploaded approch1.py. A path planner with obstavle avoidance.

21th MAY：Thanks to GOD. with constraints it finally works. Also thanks to the help of Xin Ke.♥ NEXT TO DO: get it work on REAL TRACK as well as handle obstacles.
